Earlier this year I had the pleasure of joining [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/) on his regular livestream series [*Learn With Jason* on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf).

![Logo and Sketching with Maggie Appleton on Learn with Jason](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/twitch-event-images-v2/885c31a8-d954-488f-8052-2f38b08caf01-640x360)

Usually he hosts developers building impressive demos like [three.js animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcawneCRHY), [serverless GraphQL functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6trl0_ynuM), and [data vizualisations in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdeu-BFisJU&t=3271s).
There's a whole [YouTube archive you can pour over](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnty0z0pNRDgnuoirYXnC5A/videos).

### Watch the livestream video

We were sketching logo ideas for an app/website/project called **Secret Sandwich** that Jason's been building on the stream with various guests.

Here's the quick pitch – it's an app you can use to host sandwich-themed dinner parties.  It follows the same rules as [Secret Santa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) – everyone is assigned another person, and you have to make a surprise sandwich you think your sandwichee would enjoy.

It was mostly a fun hour of us mashing together associative ideas based around *sandwiches* and *secrets*. 

I'm not going to claim the sketches are terribly impressive or ingenius, but at least the livestream session was a good time!

## The Process

Both Jason and I were sketching on iPads which we hooked up to our zoom call and livestreamed onto twitch. ✨Technological magic ✨

We started by tossing around a few associative ideas around our core themes of **sandwiches** and **secrets**. This included perogies, metasandwiches, NSA cryptography, the Wizard of Oz, and [Super secret secret squirrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Squirrel)

We mostly jammed off our own free assocaition ideas, but I snuck in a quick demo of my favourite *"word nerd"* tools that I use for exploring concepts.

<div style="display: grid; 
          grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));">
    <LinkCard title="One Look Thesaurus" url="https://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/" description="OneLook Thesaurus is my favourite" />
    <LinkCard title="English Corpuses" url="https://www.english-corpora.org/" img="./ety.png" description="A Corpus is just an enourmous collection of words.I mostly use the iWeb Corpus since it searches the word across a vast swath of the internet. Which as built by a bunch of academics and has horrendous UX but is great to dig throuh." />

    <LinkCard title="Etymology Dictionary" url="https://www.etymonline.com/" description="waesrdtfyguhj" />
</div>


Once we had set of long wordlists based off our keywords.
