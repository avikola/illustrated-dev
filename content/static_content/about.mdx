# Illustrated.dev explains web development through illustration.

Most of these explainers are about JavaScript fundamentals. Because those never go out of style.
But I've also made a few on newer tools like React, Babel, and D3.

I make these because the front-end world is overflowing with confounding things to learn (and JavaScript in particular is 🔥❗🍌🌟☠ ridiculous sometimes).

Looking at the programming world through visual metaphors turns out to be a really effective learning tool. All the abstract jargon & syntax is much easier to understand when you can _see_ what's happening through diagrams and analogies.

Not to mention it's a hell of a lot more interesting than slogging through some fat textbook.


<!-- ### Who Makes This Stuff?

Maggie + the generous team & community of [egghead.io](http://egghead.io)

I'm an illustrator-developer hybrid who gets overexcited by metaphors and translating buzzwords into normal human language. 

While I do a fair bit of the research and writing myself, I also get collborate with developers who are true experts in their niche to develop the content. I rely heavily on the core team and instructors at [egghead](http://egghead.io), as well as the JS community on Twitter to make sure all the learning material is on point. -->
