## Illustrated.dev explains web development through illustration.

Most of them are on JavaScript fundamentals. Because those never go out of style.
But I've also made some on newer tools like React, Babel, and D3.

I make these because the front-end world is overflowing with confounding things to learn (and JavaScript in particular is üçåüåüüëª‚Äº‚ò† ridiculous sometimes).
Looking at the programming world through visual metaphors turns out to be a really effective learning tool. All the abstract jargon & syntax is much easier to understand when you can _see_ what's happening through diagrams and analogies. Not to mention it's a hell of a lot more interesting than slogging through some fat textbook.


### Who Makes This Stuff?

I'm an illustrator-developer hybrid who gets overexcited by metaphors and translating buzzwords into normal human language. 

While I do a fair bit of the research and writing myself, I also rely heavily on the expertise of the core team and instructors at [egghead.io](http://egghead.io). As well as the generosity of the JS community on Twitter.
