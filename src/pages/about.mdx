## Illustrated.dev explains web development through illustration.

Because the front-end world is overflowing with confounding concepts. And JavaScript is 🍌🌟👻‼☠ ridiculous sometimes.

Visual narratives are a fantastic medium for making exactly those sort of abstract theories clear and concrete. Not to mention a hell of a lot more interesting than slogging through some fat textbook.


### Who Makes This Stuff?

I'm an illustrator-developer hybrid who gets overexcited by visual metaphors and simplifying overly complex jargon into normal human language.

While I do a fair bit of the research and writing myself, I also rely heavily on the expertise of the core team and instructors at [egghead.io](http://egghead.io). As well as the generosity of the JS community on Twitter.
